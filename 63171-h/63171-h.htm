  <h2 class='c007'>THE PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Art supervisors in the public schools assign picture-study
work in each grade, recommending the study of certain pictures
by well-known masters. As Supervisor of Drawing I found
that the children enjoyed this work but that the teachers felt
incompetent to conduct the lessons as they lacked time to
look up the subject and to gather adequate material. Recourse
to a great many books was necessary and often while
much information could usually be found about the artist,
very little was available about his pictures.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hence I began collecting information about the pictures
and preparing the lessons for the teachers just as I would
give them myself to pupils of their grade.</p>

<p class='c012'>My plan does not include many pictures during the year,
as this is to be only a part of the art work and is not intended
to take the place of drawing.</p>

<p class='c012'>The lessons in this grade may be used for the usual drawing
period of from twenty to thirty minutes, and have been successfully
given in that time. However, the most satisfactory way
of using the books is as supplementary readers, thus permitting
each child to study the pictures and read the stories himself.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Questions to arouse interest.</b> What is represented
in this picture? Which boat is the
<i>Téméraire</i>? What smaller boat is towing it?
Why do you think it needs to be towed? What
is the time of day? What makes you think
so? Is the ship moving or stationary? Why
does it float so high in the water? What other
boats can you see in this picture? What can
you see in the background? What is the condition
of the water? What kind of a feeling
does this picture give you? Why do you like
the picture?</p>

      <div class='line'><b>Original Picture</b>: National Gallery, London, England.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Artist</b>: Joseph Mallord William Turner.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Birthplace</b>: London, England.</div>
      <div class='line'><b>Dates</b>: Born, 1775; died, 1851.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The story of the picture.</b> One evening when
the artist, Mr. Turner, and a party of friends
were sailing down the river Thames in London,
there suddenly loomed before their astonished
gaze the dark hull of the famous ship called
the <i>Téméraire</i>. They had heard and read of
the many great victories won by this noble
vessel, and the glory it had brought to England.
Its name Téméraire means “the one who
dares.” Now its days of usefulness were over,
and it was being towed to its last place of
anchor to be broken up.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first they gazed in silence, for it was a
sad and solemn sight to watch this feeble old
boat creeping along like a disabled soldier, its
former glories fading like the setting sun. The
silence was broken by the exclamation of one
of the young men, “Ah, what a subject for a
picture!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet we must remember that at the time
Turner painted this picture it was considered
just as commonplace and uninteresting to
paint a sailing vessel as it would be for our
artists to paint a bicycle or a wagon.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Turner painted something more than
a picture of a boat. He has made us feel not
only the sadness in this parting scene but also
all the glories of the splendid victories won in
former days. Again we recall the Battle of the
Nile, when the English commander, Lord
Nelson, won the victory over Napoleon’s fleet
and captured the <i>Téméraire</i> from the French.
We remember how Nelson, then a young man
but having already lost an arm and an eye in
battle, was put in command of the English
fleet and sent against the French; how after
a severe storm the two fleets, going in opposite
directions, passed each other in the fog, Nelson
reaching Italy and Napoleon landing in Egypt.
Then the older naval officers in England, who
thought they should have been appointed to
this important command, said all they could
about the folly of sending so young a man as
Nelson, and told how much better they could
have done. So the people were dissatisfied and
finally the order for extra supplies and provisions
was countermanded just as Nelson heard where
Napoleon was and wanted to start out. Then
Lady Hamilton, the wife of the English minister
to Italy, used her influence in his behalf, and
the provisions were furnished secretly. We do
not care to dwell long on that fierce Battle of
the Nile, which began after six o’clock in the
evening and lasted all night. Only the flashes
of the guns told the positions of the different
boats until the burning of the French flagship
made a more terrible illumination. It was a
great victory for the English.</p>

<p class='c012'>For forty years after this the <i>Téméraire</i>
remained in active service. It took part in
the famous victory at the Battle of Trafalgar;
it was the second ship in line, and the first to
catch Nelson’s well-known words, “England
expects that every man will do his duty.”
Many lives were lost in this battle, among them
that of the great commander.</p>

<p class='c012'>At length the good old ship was considered
unfit for active service. Then for several
years it was used as a training ship for cadets.
Now, no longer fit for that either, it was to
be broken up for lumber. At the time when
the <i>Téméraire</i> was captured all war vessels
used sails, but less than twenty-five years
later they began to use steam. That, too,
was a reason why the <i>Téméraire</i> was to
be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Turner, who was born near the river
Thames and grew up among boats and sailors,
the sight of this old boat made a strong appeal,
not only because he was an artist, but because
he was also a patriotic Englishman full of pride
in the ship’s great victories.</p>

<p class='c012'>The setting sun casts a parting glow upon
the great, empty vessel as it stands high out of
the water. The sky is ablaze with rosy light,
which is reflected in the quiet surface of the
Thames, but our eyes are drawn at once to the
great <i>Téméraire</i>. We glance at the long, dark
shadows and reflections of the two vessels, but
soon find our eyes wandering to the brilliantly
lighted masts, to the gorgeous sunset sky, and
back again to the proud old boat. In the dark
smoke of the tug there is a touch of brilliant
red.</p>

<p class='c012'>The small boats scattered here and there
help to bring out the distance from that faraway
shore so unconscious of the passing of
the great ship. At least three fourths of the
picture is sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>All of Turner’s first paintings were in tones
of blues and grays, so soft and delicate they
were often indistinct. It was not until after he
had traveled through Italy, and spent many
days in Venice, where all is brilliant color,
that he began to make his pictures blaze with
color. He had completely mastered the pale
shades, so it needed but a touch of brilliant
color here and there to make his whole picture
glow. In “The Fighting Téméraire” more than
half the picture is painted in the soft gray colors
of dusk, but the sunset and the touch of red in
the smoke of the tug seem to set the whole
picture aflame. A gentleman once said to
Turner, after looking at this picture, “I never
saw a sunset like that.” Turner replied, “No,
but don’t you wish you could?”</p>

<p class='c012'>In Turner’s day water colors were very popular,
and Turner painted a great many of them.
His water colors are much better preserved than
his oil paintings. The “Téméraire” was painted
in oils. The sky has faded considerably in the
original picture, and others of his oil paintings
have become indistinct. It is believed that this
is because he so often used poor materials.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turner himself considered this picture, “The
Fighting Téméraire Tugged to Her Last Berth
to be Broken Up,” as he called it, his best work,
and bequeathed it to the National Gallery in
London, refusing to sell it for any price.</p>

<p class='c012'>You will remember that later, when America
proposed a similar fate for our battleship, <i>Constitution</i>,
the people raised a protest and the
plan was given up. It was then that Holmes
wrote his famous “Old Ironsides,” which might
have applied equally well to the <i>Téméraire</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the
picture.</b> How did the artist happen to see
this ship? What does the name “Téméraire”
mean? For what was this vessel famous? Tell
about Lord Nelson and the Battle of the Nile.
From whom did he capture the <i>Téméraire</i>?
When was this battle fought? Tell about the
Battle of Trafalgar. What saying of Nelson’s
has become famous? Who won the victory?
What became of the <i>Téméraire</i> then? Why
was it now to be broken to pieces? Before the
use of steam, how were vessels propelled?
How was the <i>Téméraire</i> propelled? To what
did Turner compare this old ship? Why was
it a sad sight to him? What colors did he use
in this picture? How did the artist consider
this painting? To whom did he leave it? Why
did Americans object when it was proposed
that the battleship <i>Constitution</i> be broken up?</p>

<p class='c012'><b>To the Teacher</b>: A description of the picture
may be prepared by a pupil and given
orally to the class. This may be followed by a
written description of the picture and a short
biography of the artist, as a class exercise in
connection with the English composition work.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Joseph Mallord
William Turner was born, lived, and died in
London. His father was a jolly little barber
who curled wigs and dressed the hair of English
dandies, as did all the barbers in those
days. He was very popular because he was
so good-natured and full of fun. He was also
very ambitious for his little son, who had been
left to his care by the death of the mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>The story is told that one day, when Joseph
was six years old, his father was called to the
home of a wealthy patron, and, having no one
with whom to leave the child, he took the boy
with him. At the patron’s home the little boy
climbed up into a big chair and waited patiently,
but it seemed a very long time indeed before
his father could satisfy the exacting customer.
Finally the boy became interested in studying a
carved lion on a silver tray lying on the table
near by. He studied this lion so carefully that
when they reached home, and while his father
was preparing their supper, he drew a lion in
full action, and brought the drawing to show
his father. It was decided then and there that
Joseph should be an artist. The father also
wished that his son might receive an education.
But Turner did not learn much at school, for as
soon as the boys and girls found he could draw
wonderful pictures they offered to do his sums
for him and helped him with his lessons while
he drew pictures for them in return.</p>

<p class='c012'>The jolly little barber was so pleased with
his son’s drawings that he put them up in his
shop. His patrons began to inquire about the
little artist, and when the proud father put a
price mark on the drawings, they were soon
sold. Later, Turner was apprenticed to an
architect to learn architectural drawing, but he
was not successful. He did not seem to be
able to understand the theory of perspective
or even the first steps in geometry. However,
he finally must have mastered these subjects,
for some years later he became Professor of
Perspective at the Royal Academy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later in life Turner traveled in France,
Germany, and Italy, and it was then he began
to use those brilliant colors which we always
associate with his work. Turner rarely sold
any of his paintings. He called them his
“children,” and was unwilling to part with
them. But his engravings and illustrations
made him very wealthy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of Turner’s many pictures of the sea,
perhaps the best known is “The Slave Ship.”
Other famous pictures by Turner are “Rain,
Steam, and Speed, the Great Western Railway,”
“Steamer off Harbour’s Mouth Making
Signals,” “Approach to Venice,” “Ulysses Deriding
Polyphemus,” “Sun Rising in a Mist,”
and “Shade and Darkness—The Evening of
the Deluge.”</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Where was the
artist born? What did his father do for a living?
How did Turner happen to draw his first
picture? Why did he not learn much at school?
What did his father do with his drawings?

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> Far away among
the wild hills of France, in the village of Domremy,
lived Joan of Arc, the “Maid of Orleans.”
Her father was a small farmer, and all her people
were working people. Joan’s life was not an
idle one, for we are told that she was an expert
at sewing and spinning, that she tended the
sheep and cattle, and rode the horses to and
from the watering places. But she could neither
read nor write, as she had received no education.
When she wished to send a letter she would
dictate it to some one who could write, and
then make the mark of a cross at the top. As
she was of an intensely religious nature, she
often wandered off by herself and remained in
prayer for hours, sometimes in the fields or the
great forest near by, and sometimes in the
village church.</p>

<p class='c012'>About this time France was frequently
invaded by the English, and even the small
village in which Joan lived had been entered
and plundered.</p>

<p class='c012'>There had been so many intermarriages
between the royal houses of France and England
that it was doubtful who was the rightful
heir to the throne. France was divided into
two factions, yet all agreed in their hatred of
the English who had taken possession of the
northern part of the country. Worst of all,
the queen mother Isabella supported the claims
of her grandson, an Englishman, against those of
her own son, Charles, the French prince.</p>

<p class='c012'>This agreed with an old prophecy known to
the country people, that France should be lost
by a woman and saved by a woman. The
queen, Isabella, who finally secured the crown
for her English grandson, was regarded as the
woman who lost France; and later it became
generally believed that Joan of Arc was the
woman who saved France.</p>

<p class='c012'>Joan prayed constantly for the deliverance
of her country from the English. At last one
day she told her father that she had seen an
unearthly light and heard a voice telling her
that she was to go and help the French prince.
Again the vision appeared, and this time she
said she had seen St. Michael, St. Catherine,
and St. Margaret, who told her that she was
appointed by heaven to go to the aid of Prince
Charles. Her father tried to laugh her out of
her “fancy,” as he called it, and did all he could
to dissuade her, but Joan was resolute and
declared she must go.</p>

<p class='c012'>The village people were very superstitious,
and when they heard of Joan’s wonderful visions
they were immediately convinced. An uncle of
Joan’s, who was a wheelwright and cartmaker,
offered to take her to a high nobleman who,
according to the vision, should bring her before
the prince. This nobleman laughed at her,
but later on became sufficiently convinced to
give her a horse, a suit of armor, and two
guards to escort her to Prince Charles.</p>

<p class='c012'>After traveling eleven days through a wild
country, constantly on the watch for the enemy,
she finally reached Chinon, where Charles was
staying. Although he was dressed exactly like
the men about him, Joan picked him out
immediately, and told him she had been sent
by heaven to conquer his enemies and see him
crowned king at Rheims. She also told him
several things supposed to be secret, known
only to himself, and so she was able to gain
his confidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>She told him too that in the Cathedral of St.
Catherine, some distance away, he would find
an old sword, marked on the blade with five
crosses, which the vision had told her she should
wear. No one had ever heard of this old sword,
and it seemed very wonderful that Joan should
know about it; but it was found in the cathedral
just as she had said.</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles then asked the opinion of all the
wise men about him, and all agreed that Joan
was inspired by heaven. This put new life
into the French soldiers, but discouraged the
English, who thought Joan was a witch.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then it was that Joan rode on to the
Siege of Orleans in which, as we know, the
French were victorious. She rode on a beautiful
white war horse, her armor glittering so
in the sun that she could be seen for a great
distance, and she carried a white flag. Twice
she was wounded during the terrible battle
which followed, but each time she was soon
up and at the head of the French again, the
English fleeing before them.</p>

<p class='c012'>We know how the French fought their way
to Rheims, where Charles VII was crowned;
and how Joan then declared her work completed
and begged to be allowed to return to her home;
but King Charles would not consent. We do
not like to think of how this weak king did
nothing to help her when she was finally taken
prisoner and sold by the Duke of Burgundy
to the English, who burned her at the stake
as a heretic and witch. It was not until ten
years later that Charles VII publicly recognized
the service she had done, and declared her “a
martyr to her religion, her country, and her
king.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In the picture we see the “Maid of Orleans”
listening to the voices. As she sat in the shade
of the great apple tree winding yarn, she had
suddenly heard voices, and then a vision of
St. Michael, St. Margaret, and St. Catherine,
the saints to whom she had prayed so often
in the little church, appeared before her. She
trembled, and rising, walked forward. Now,
leaning against a tree, she gazes at the vision.
She imagines herself clad in armor and presented
with a sword by the saints, who tell her
that heaven commands her to free France from
the English.</p>

<p class='c012'>With its fruit trees, flowers, and vegetables,
the French garden represented in the picture
was painted from nature. In the distance we
see a suggestion of the great forest in which Joan
used to wander in solitude and prayer. A
simple peasant girl, poorly dressed, there is
little about her to please or attract us until we
look at the eyes. Then we begin to understand
why this picture is considered a masterpiece.
Those great, far-seeing, melancholy eyes seem
to look far beyond us, and their ecstatic gaze
inspires us with some of that same confidence
in her which so possessed her soldiers.</p>

<p class='c012'>The vision which so inspired Joan is partly
visible to us amid the tangle of the trees and
shrubbery. The figures of the three saints
silhouetted against the rude peasant hut add
to the confusing details of the background,
and yet by them our eyes are led back to the
one restful part of the picture—Joan herself.
She is not beautiful, only earnest and good, and
we feel a great pity for this girl who is so soon
to suffer a dreadful fate for an ungrateful king
and people.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sunlight falls full upon her face and
outstretched arm. The curve of this arm harmonizes
with the branches of the trees above,
and her upright figure with the straight tree
trunks. Her firm chin tells us something of
the determination and courage which carried
her through to the end.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are told that she had a deep, strong
voice which was capable of great sweetness, and
that her honesty and goodness compelled the
respect of even the rudest soldiers.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>To the Teacher</b>: Different pupils may be
asked to study this lesson under the following

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Jules Bastien-Lepage
was born in Damvillers, France. His parents
were people of means, and as his father was an
artist he received his first art instructions from
him. As a young man Jules held a position
in the post office, and his duties there kept
him busy every morning. But all his afternoons
were devoted to study under an artist
who lived near by.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then during the Franco-Prussian war he
joined the army in the defense of Paris. He was
never very strong, and the constant exposure
and hardships forced him to return home on
sick leave; that was the end of his experience
as a soldier. His health somewhat recovered,
he began painting in earnest. He desired above
all things to be a great historical painter and,
if possible, to paint these pictures at the very
places where the historical events occurred.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had a very fine studio fitted up on the
second floor at home, but most of his painting
was done out of doors.</p>

<p class='c012'>We cannot read much of his life without
finding some mention of his grandfather, for it
was the old man’s delight to work or sit beside
his grandson while the young man was painting.
The grandfather is usually described as
wearing a brown skull cap and spectacles, and
carrying his snuffbox and large checked handkerchief
much in evidence. He took care of
their garden and orchard, and one of the very
first pictures Lepage painted that caused most
favorable comment was a portrait of his grandfather
in a corner of the garden. This picture,
together with another of a young peasant girl,
exhibited at the same time, marked the beginning
of the artist’s popularity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Born in the same country as Millet and
like him understanding the religious enthusiasm
and the superstitions of the peasants, we are
not surprised that he should love to paint the
French peasant and that Joan of Arc’s life and
history should have appealed to him so strongly.
This subject had been a favorite theme for
painters for several hundred years, and most
of the artists had represented Joan as a saint
or as a maid of great beauty. Lepage, however,
represented her as a simple peasant girl,
dressed as such, and showing evidence in her
face and her coarse hands of the rough farm
work she had been doing.</p>

<p class='c012'>This painting of Joan of Arc is considered
the artist’s masterpiece. Another noted picture
by him is “The Hay Makers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bastien-Lepage became very popular indeed,
and the people vied with each other to obtain
his paintings and to get an opportunity to work
in his studio. He worked very hard, and this,
with the excitement of so much publicity,
finally wore him out. He died at the age of
thirty-six years.</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture, and where was he born? Where
is the original painting? Tell about Jules
Bastien-Lepage and his early training. Why
did he not remain in the army? What kind
of a painter did he most desire to be? Where
did he usually paint? Who went with him?
Describe the old grandfather. What picture
marked the beginning of the artist’s popularity?
Why did the life of Joan of Arc appeal to him
so strongly? In what way did his representation
of Joan differ from that of other artists?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> This picture represents
the syndics of the Cloth Merchants’ Guild,
in a room of their Guild House, busy going over
their accounts. In these days of great corporations
and societies of all kinds, it is easy
for us to understand what a Cloth Merchants’
Guild might be.</p>

<p class='c012'>History tells us that as far back as the time
of the Romans there were what were called
merchants’ corporations or guilds organized for
mutual aid and protection. Among the very
first known was a fishermen’s guild, in which
all the members met and decided the rights of
the various members to use the water front,
and also, no doubt, planned to take away the
privilege from all who were not members.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Netherlands the guilds were many
and very influential. Besides the general officers
usually appointed by the king, there were
a certain number of officers whom the members
themselves chose, called masters, deans,
wardens, or syndics. It was the duty of these
syndics to visit the workshops and salesrooms
of all members of the guild, at all hours, to see
that the rules were enforced. They were also
expected to examine candidates for apprenticeship
and mastership. Each guild had its own
costume or uniform. Even to this day a
remnant of these old customs remains, and in
England every twenty years a few of the cities
celebrate, by a very important and imposing
parade, what is known as “guild day.” Many
cities still have the old Guild Houses where
these meetings were held, and there is not a
cathedral or church building of any importance
in the Netherlands or Belgium in which some
great event connected with these guilds is not
represented by either a painting or a sculptured
monument. And so it is little wonder that
Rembrandt should paint such a picture as this.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is as if we opened the door suddenly
upon the syndics, who look up to see what has
disturbed them. One man has half risen from
his chair. All five are dressed in the uniform
of the guild—black coats, broad white collars,
and large black felt hats. Each figure is a
complete portrait in itself and bears, it is said,
a speaking likeness to the syndic painted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some time before this, Rembrandt had had
an unfortunate experience. He had painted a
wonderful picture called the “Night Watch.”
But in that great painting he had allowed his
feelings as an artist, and his love of a fine composition,
to make him forget man’s vanity.
So, although a great many prominent men had
posed for this picture, he had neglected to paint
them all in conspicuous positions. Those upon
whom the bright light fell were delighted with
the picture, but the majority, who were in the
shadow, did not like it at all and so refused to
pay any money toward buying it. The truth
is they had each expected a good portrait, and
instead he had painted a masterpiece in composition.</p>

<p class='c012'>So in this later picture he was careful to
make a good likeness of each of the syndics,
as well as to make an interesting composition.</p>

<p class='c012'>These five syndics are gathered around a
table covered with a rich oriental cloth woven on
a dark red ground. The plain paneled walls
of the room are brown, filling the picture
with that rich golden-brown tone for which
Rembrandt is famous and which gives to his
pictures their mysterious and peculiar charm.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is said that the other portraits in the Ryks
Museum, Amsterdam, where this picture is
hung, look dull and lifeless beside it. And,
strange to say, it was painted when Rembrandt
was fast losing his eyesight and when, too,
he was in great financial difficulties. The
order for the picture was given him by an old
friend who thought first of his need, but later
of his great genius. It was Rembrandt’s last
important order before his death in 1669.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although these men are looking toward us,
no two are in exactly the same position. The
light from the window falls full on the face of
each syndic; even the servant is not placed in
the shadow. Suppose these men had been
represented as of exactly the same height; that
would have given us a straight horizontal line
across the picture even straighter than that
of the wainscoting above, which is broken by
the corner of the room. Thus we would have
had a stiff, uninteresting arrangement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Art students from all over the world go to
the Art Museum to study and copy parts of
this wonderful painting. Joseph Israels tells
us he made a copy of his favorite figure, which
was “the man in the left-hand corner with the
soft gray hair under the steeple hat.”</p>

Where is the original painting?</p>
<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Rembrandt was
born in Leiden, the Netherlands, in 1606. In
those days, when there were no newspapers and
no one cared to set down the daily events in
the lives of great men, it was only what the
man actually accomplished that was recorded.
So we know very little of the early life of
Rembrandt. Some authorities declare he was
born in a windmill, but most agree that as his
father was a prosperous miller, the son was no
doubt born in a very comfortable if not elegant
home. However that may be, we know that
Rembrandt spent many happy hours with his
brothers and sisters high up in this windmill,
and here it is believed he first studied the
effect of light and shade on objects.</p>

<p class='c012'>From the small window in the tiny room at
the top of the mill little light could be expected,
and as he did much of his painting here his
studies were mostly in shadow. Often he must
have looked from this little window down upon
the quaint city of Leiden, built upon its ninety
islands joined by at least a hundred and fifty
bridges; upon its wide streets, rose-bordered
canals, houses built in rows, each with its
own windmill, and the picturesque rows of
trees. The largest building of all was the
University, for which Leiden is still famous.
Rembrandt attended this university, we are
told, and as he looked at it he must have
recalled its history and how bravely the Dutch
people fought when the Spanish army tried
to capture the city—how they braved famine
and pestilence as they awaited the arrival of
Prince William of Orange. As a reward for
their courage, William offered his people either
a great gift of gold or a university; and, although
the people needed the money to rebuild their
houses, they chose the university.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rembrandt is one of the great artists who
is known to the world by his first name. His
father’s name was Gerrit Harmens and he was
called Harmens van Rijn (by the Rhine).
According to a custom of those days the name
frequently told where the man lived. His son
was called Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn,
meaning Rembrandt, son of Harmens by the
Rhine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rembrandt’s great love for good pictures,
and his desire to draw, caused his parents to
send him to an artist to study. He studied
with this teacher at home for three years.
Then he spent several months in Amsterdam
studying, but finally decided that nature should
be his teacher. He was then only sixteen years
old, but he fitted up the little room in the mill
as a studio, and here he continued his study.
He painted his father, his mother, and his
brothers and sisters many times. Then he
painted his own portrait by looking in a mirror,
and, by assuming various attitudes and different
expressions, he received much valuable practice
which, later on, helped him greatly.</p>

<p class='c012'>His first great work was a portrait of his
mother, painted when he was twenty-three years
old. Two years later he went to Amsterdam,
where his pictures brought large prices and
pupils flocked to him from all parts of Europe.
Once he painted a window with a servant
standing near it that was so real it deceived
every one.</p>

<p class='c012'>About this time he married the beautiful
Saskia, whose picture he has painted so many
times. His home was furnished extravagantly,
and nothing was too good to give Saskia.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are three great paintings by Rembrandt
which mark three epochs in his life.
The first was “The Anatomy Lesson,” painted
for Doctor Tulp, representing the Professor of
Anatomy lecturing to his class. It is said that
Rembrandt hid behind a curtain and, without
their knowledge, observed the class during
several lessons that he might secure natural
expressions and positions. This picture was
painted shortly after his marriage to Saskia,
and through it he became famous. It marks
the beginning of the happiest part of his life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The second great painting was the “Night
Watch,” which was not appreciated because he
failed to give all the figures equal prominence.
This picture marks the beginning of his fall
from favor, and it was about this time that his
wife, Saskia, died.</p>

<p class='c012'>Crushed by both sorrow and misfortune,
Rembrandt still continued to paint. His choice
of subjects, however, changed noticeably. He
now painted more of the sorrow, poverty, and
distress of life. His house, with all its beautiful
furnishings, was sold.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came his great painting, “The Syndics
of the Cloth Hall,” in which he seems to have
concentrated all his wonderful genius. But,
masterpiece that it is, the picture won no popularity,
and so the last years of Rembrandt’s life
were spent in increasing poverty and sadness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other noted pictures by Rembrandt are:
“Christ Blessing Little Children,” “Sacrifice of
Abraham,” “Portrait of an Old Woman,” “The
Mill,” “Saskia,” and “Supper at Emmaus.”</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Who painted
this picture? Why was he so named? Why
do we know so little about him? Where is it
believed that Rembrandt first studied light
and shade? What other training did he have?
How did he paint his own portrait? What was
his first great painting? Tell something which
illustrates how well he could paint. Was the
greatness of “The Syndics of the Cloth Hall”
appreciated when it appeared?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> Beatrice, the good
and beautiful wife of the Duke of Milan, had
visited most of the many convents in Italy,
but her favorite among them all was the Santa
Maria delle Grazie in Milan. When the great
dining room of this beautiful convent was
being finished, the monks felt that it lacked
nothing except a suitable decoration for the end
wall; so they appealed to the duke and his
wife for at least one fine painting by the most
popular artist of the time, Leonardo da Vinci.
And so it came about that Leonardo began
this great work, which was to be his masterpiece.
It was so placed that the monks seated at their
meals could see the long table as if it were in their
own room and but slightly raised above the rest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many stories are told of the artist while
working on this great painting. Often he
worked from early morning until dusk, quite
unconscious of the flight of time, of his meals,
or of the hushed voices of the monks and
visitors who came to watch him paint. Then
again he would not paint for several days,
but would sit for hours quietly studying his
painting. The prior of the monastery began
to think he would never finish the picture, and
at last he appealed to the duke to speak to
Leonardo about it. The artist told the duke
that while he sat thinking he was doing his best
work, for it was necessary for him to have a
complete picture in his mind before he could
paint one. Of course he was told to do it in
his own way. He completed the painting in
two years, which was an unusually short time
for so great a masterpiece, when we consider
how much study was necessary, and that the
figures were larger than life. Leonardo also
had other work which had to be done.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. William Wetmore Story has given us
the prior’s complaint to the duke in verse, from
which we have selected these extracts:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis twenty months since first upon the wall</div>
      <div class='line in1'>This Leonardo smoothed his plaster; then</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He spent two months ere he began to scrawl</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His figures, which were scarcely outlined, when,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Seized by some mad whim, he erased them all.</div>

      <div class='line'>“Ah! there he is now—Would your Highness look</div>

      <div class='line in1'>See how he pulls his beard, as up and down</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Your Highness would vouchsafe one word to say;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For when I speak he only answers me,</div>

    </div>

      <div class='line in4'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Not idle! Well, I know not what you do!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You do not paint our picture, that I see.’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To which he said, “A picture is not wrought</div>
      <div class='line in1'>By hands alone, good Padre, but by thought.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In the interior life it first must start,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And grow to form and color in the soul;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While I seem idle, then my soul creates;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While I am painting, then my hand translates.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is said that Leonardo threatened to paint
the face of the complaining prior as the Judas
in his picture, but we know that he did not.</p>

<p class='c012'>He has chosen for his subject the moment
following the words of Christ to his disciples:
“One of you shall betray me.” On their faces
he has shown the surprise, consternation, and
distress which would naturally follow the realization
that there is a traitor among them.</p>

<p class='c012'>We recognize at once the calm, beautiful
face of the figure in the center as that of the
Christ. Leonardo spent more time on this
head than on any other part of the picture. He
made a great many sketches, and in each he
tried to represent Christ as looking at us, but
all his efforts failed to satisfy him. At last he
consulted a friend, who advised him to give up
trying to paint the expression of the eyes, but
to represent Christ looking down; and this seems
to have been the last touch needed to make the
face perfect.</p>

<p class='c012'>On both sides we see the disciples in four
groups of three each. If we study any one
of these groups we will find it complete in
itself, yet all four groups are held together by
the expression on the faces and especially by the
position of the hands. So wonderfully have
the hands been painted that some critics have
spoken of this picture as “a study of hands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If we begin at the left-hand side of the picture
we see Bartholomew standing at the end. In
his astonishment, he has risen so quickly that
his feet are still crossed as they were when he
was seated. He looks toward Christ as if he
thought his ears must have deceived him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next to Bartholomew is James (the less),
who reaches behind Andrew to touch the arm
of Peter and urge him to ask the meaning of it
all. Andrew’s uplifted hands express horror,
while his face is turned anxiously toward the
Master. Peter is greatly excited, but feels
that John is the one to ask the question; so we
see him leaning toward John, his hand resting
on John’s shoulder as he eagerly urges him to
ask who it is of whom Christ spoke. In his
right hand Peter grasps his knife ready to
defend his Lord.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between Peter and John we see the traitor
Judas, vainly attempting to appear innocent
and unconcerned. As he leans forward, he
clasps his money bag tighter, but at the first
sudden movement of alarm he has overturned
the salt upon the table. It is said that after
the face of the Christ, Leonardo found that of
Judas the most difficult to paint. It was hard
to imagine a man so wicked.</p>

<p class='c012'>The gentle, sorrowful face of John seated
next to the Christ is in strong contrast to the
startled, guilty look on the dark face of Judas.</p>

<p class='c012'>To the right of the Master, we see James
(the great), whose arms are outstretched as he
looks at the Master and eagerly asks, “Lord,
is it I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just behind James is Thomas, with one
finger lifted threateningly as if he must know
who the traitor is that he may cast him out at
once.</p>

<p class='c012'>Philip, standing beside James, places his
hands on his heart as he says, “Thou knowest,
dear Lord, it is not I.” The three disciples at
the end of the table are in earnest conversation.
Matthew points with his arms to the Saviour as
if explaining to the elder disciple, Simon, what
has just been said. His face asks a question
and expresses wonder, while that of Thaddeus,
next to him, is worried and troubled. Simon
holds his hands out and looks appealingly to
Christ for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>The table itself was like that used in the
dining room of the convent; even the tablecloth
and china were the same. Three windows form
a background for the picture, and the middle
one frames the face of the Christ.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the picture was painted in tempera
upon damp walls, and it soon began to fade
and even to peel off. If it had not been for an
Italian who made an engraving of this picture
shortly after it was finished, we should have
little idea of the real beauty of the original.
At one time the convent was used as a stable,
and a door was cut right through the middle
and lower part of the picture. Naturally, in
the course of time, the picture lost most of its
original splendor. Many attempts were made
to preserve it, but without success. Then, not
many years ago, an artist was found who
succeeded in restoring the picture to some
degree of perfection.</p>

<p class='c012'>The painting is twenty-eight feet long, and
the figures are all larger than life.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Leonardo da Vinci
was born in the little village called Vinci, about
twenty miles from Florence, Italy. His father
was a country lawyer of considerable wealth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Very little is known of Leonardo’s boyhood,
except that he grew up on his father’s estate and
early displayed remarkable talents. He was
good-looking, strong, energetic, and an excellent
student. He was especially good in arithmetic,
and liked to make up problems of his own
which even his teacher found interesting and
difficult. Above all he loved to wander out
in the great forest near the palace and to tame
lizards, snakes, and many kinds of animals.
Here he invented a lute upon which he played
wonderful music of his own composing. Then,
too, he sang his own songs and recited his own
poems.</p>

<p class='c012'>He loved to draw and paint because he could
both represent the things he loved and use
his inventive genius as well. He seemed to be
gifted along so many lines, and was of such an
inquiring mind, that it was difficult for him to
work long enough at one thing to finish it. We
read of him as musician, poet, inventor, scientist,
philosopher, and last, but most important to
us—as artist.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he was fifteen years old he made some
sketches which were so very clever that his
father took them to a great artist, Verrocchio,
who was delighted with them and was glad to
take Leonardo as his pupil. The story is told
that when Verrocchio was painting a large
picture he asked Leonardo to paint one of the
angels in the background. The boy spent much
time and study on this work, and finally
succeeded in painting an angel which was so
beautiful that the rest of the picture seemed
commonplace. It is said that Verrocchio felt
very sad at the thought that a mere boy could
surpass him, and declared he would paint no
more pictures, but would devote his life to
design and sculpture.</p>

<p class='c012'>One time one of the servants of the castle
brought Leonardo’s father a round piece of wood
and asked him to have his son paint something
on it that would make it suitable for a shield,
like the real shields that hung in the castle hall.
Leonardo wanted to surprise his father. So he
made a collection of all the lizards, snakes, bats,
dragonflies, and toads that he could find and
painted a picture, in which he combined their
various parts, making a fearful dragon breathing
out flame and just ready to spring from the
shield. Coming suddenly upon the shield on
his son’s easel, the father was indeed startled.
Studying the picture carefully, he declared it
was far too valuable a present for the servant;
so another shield had to be painted and the
first was sold at a great price. No one knows
what finally became of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Leonardo spent seven years with Verrocchio;
then he opened a studio of his own in Florence,
Italy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later Pope Leo X invited him to Rome to
paint for him, but most of his work there was
left unfinished. The story is told of how one
day the pope found him busily engaged in
making a new kind of varnish with which to
finish his picture. “Alas,” said the pope,
“this man will do nothing, for he thinks of
finishing his picture before he begins it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From Rome, Leonardo went to Milan, where,
with the Duke of Milan as patron, he painted
his masterpiece, “The Last Supper.” He also
made a model for an equestrian statue which,
though never executed, was regarded as equal
to anything the Greeks had ever done.</p>

<p class='c012'>Leonardo da Vinci proved to be a great addition
to the duke’s court; his fine appearance and
his many talents made him very popular indeed.
He played skillfully on a beautiful silver lyre
and charmed the people with his music and
songs. He also helped the duke found and
direct the Academy at Milan, and gave lectures
there on art and science. So his time was
divided, as usual, among his many interests.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the duke was driven out of Milan
by the new French king, Leonardo spent several
years in Florence, where he painted the famous
“Mona Lisa,” and other portraits. Then followed
a few years of travel through Italy.
At the request of the French king, Francis I,
Leonardo joined his court in France, and there
he spent the last years of his life, regarded
with great reverence and respect, and loved
by all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among the other great pictures painted by
Leonardo da Vinci are: “Mona Lisa,” “The
Christ,” “Madonna of the Rocks,” “St. Anne,”
and “John the Baptist.”</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Tell what you
can of the boyhood of Leonardo da Vinci.
What talents did he have? How did these
sometimes prevent his completing his work?
Tell the legend about the angel he painted for
Verrocchio; the wooden shield. What did the
pope say of Leonardo? why? Where was
“The Last Supper” painted? In what way
was Leonardo an addition to the duke’s court?
How was Leonardo regarded as a sculptor?

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> Into the streets
of Athens, bright with the life and brilliant
colors of its gayly dressed people, came the
uncouth figure of the philosopher Diogenes,
ridiculing all that the Athenian held most dear.
On his head he carried the tub in which he ate
and slept. At first he also carried a cup, but
after seeing a boy drink from the hollow of his
hand, he broke his cup on the pavement,
preferring the “simpler way.” His ugly, cynical
face, awkward figure, bare feet, and ragged
clothing made him an object of astonishment
and ridicule. Independent, surly, and ill-natured,
he continued to be an outcast
throughout his long life. He taught in the
streets as did many of the philosophers in those
days, and spoke so plainly and so contemptuously
of the life of the people that but for his
ready wit he must have been driven out of the
city. He himself cared nothing for abuse and
insult, and went so far in showing his contempt
for pride in others that he acquired the same
fault himself, and grew proud of his contempt
for pride. He loved to show the contempt he
felt for all the little courtesies of polite society.</p>

<p class='c012'>The story is told that Diogenes came,
uninvited and unannounced, to a dinner which
Plato, a great philosopher, was giving to a
select number of his friends, and, rubbing his
dirty feet on the rich carpets, called out, “Thus
I trample on the pride of Plato.” To which
that philosopher quickly retorted, “But with
greater pride, O Diogenes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One day he went about the streets carrying
a lantern, though the sun was shining brightly.
He seemed to be looking earnestly for something,
and when asked what he was searching for he
replied, “I am searching for an honest man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Plato gave lectures to his pupils in the
Academic Gardens, and one day Diogenes was
present. Plato defined man as “a two-legged
animal without feathers.” Diogenes immediately
seized a chicken and, having plucked
its feathers, he threw it among Plato’s pupils,
declaring it to be “one of Plato’s men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once he was captured by pirates and sold
as a slave, but even this did not subdue him,
for on being asked what he could do he declared
he could “govern men,” and urged the crier to
ask, “Who wants to buy a master?” The man
who bought him set him free, and afterwards
employed him to teach his children. That is
how Diogenes happened to be in Corinth when
Alexander the Great was passing that way.
To that great Macedonian king, who considered
himself the “son of a god” and to whom
all had knelt in homage almost worship, the
visit to Diogenes was something of a shock.
He found him in one of the poorer streets,
seated in his tub, enjoying the sun and utterly
indifferent as to who his visitor might be.
Astonished, the king said, “I am Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The answer came as proudly, “And I am
Diogenes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alexander then said, “Have you no favor
to ask of me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Diogenes replied, “to get out of my
sunlight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Far from being angry with him, Alexander
seemed to respect and admire a man strong
enough to be indifferent to his presence, and
said, “Were I not Alexander, I would be
Diogenes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It happened one day that the artist, Sir
Edwin Landseer, passing along one of the
narrower streets of London, caught a glimpse
of a dirty tramp dog resting comfortably in an
empty barrel and looking up with an impish
gaze at a well-cared-for dog. The well-kept dog
was surveying the tramp with looks of mingled
haughtiness and annoyance because of his lack
of respect. Immediately the thought came to
the artist that here were another Alexander
and Diogenes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The well-fed and carefully cared-for pet,
with his fine collar and snow-white coat, sniffs
with disgust at the dirt and poverty of the
tramp dog, yet is held in spite of himself by the
look of indifference and disrespect on the other’s
face. He, the envied dog of the neighborhood,
upon whom all honors have been showered, has
found here for the first time a dog who dares
to disregard him. And what a dog! He is
amazed, yet held, waiting to see what the tramp
dog will do.</p>

<p class='c012'>Those smaller dogs do not share the indifference
of Diogenes at the presence of this great
personage. They seem ready to run at the first
sign of danger, yet they remain near enough to
see and hear all that might happen.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two hounds in the background, waiting
so solemnly for the master, hold their heads
high in the air as if the neighborhood were not
good enough for them, and they of course could
have no interest in what is going on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably Sir Edwin Landseer meant this
picture to call attention to the vanities of human
nature, and to make us smile at them. The
expressions on the faces of these dogs are almost
human, so well do they tell their story.</p>

<p class='c012'>The hammer and nails lying on the rough
pavement near the barrel would indicate that
this is not a permanent home for the tramp
dog, but rather a temporary place of shelter
into which he has strayed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Notice how Landseer has centered our
attention on the more important dog, by color,
size, and position in the picture. The other
spots of light, even that on the edge of the
barrel, draw our eyes back to the proud
Alexander. We might not discover Diogenes
so soon if we did not follow the gaze of
Alexander.</p>

<p class='c012'>Landseer delighted in telling stories in his
pictures of animals. Rosa Bonheur and other
animal painters aimed to make the animals
appear natural and lifelike, but Landseer
wished most of all to show their relation to
human beings.</p>

<p class='c012'>This picture hangs in the National Gallery,
London, England.</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand
the picture.</b> Who was Alexander the Great?
Who was Diogenes? Tell about the life and
philosophy of Diogenes. Describe his personal
appearance; Plato’s dinner and his reply to
Diogenes. Why did Diogenes carry a lantern
in the daytime? What happened after he was
captured by the pirates? How did he happen
to be in Corinth when Alexander the Great was
there? What opinion did Alexander have of
himself? Where did he find Diogenes? What
conversation did they have? Why was this
picture called “Alexander and Diogenes”?
Why is the name appropriate? To which class
do the other dogs in the picture belong? What
are they doing? Where is the scene of this
picture laid? Why is this appropriate? What
is there unusual about this picture? What
impression do you think the artist wished to
leave with us? What devices has he used to
center our attention upon the more important
dog? upon Diogenes? Where is the original
painting?</p>
<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Sir Edwin Landseer’s
grandfather was a jeweler, and his father also
learned the jeweler’s trade. The jewelers of
that day were often asked to engrave the copper
plates that were used in printing pictures. Sir
Edwin’s father soon decided he would rather
engrave pictures than sell jewels, and he became
a very skillful engraver.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that time few people realized what an
art it was to be able to cut a picture in copper
so that a great many copies of it could be made
from one plate. They did not even consider
it an art as we do, and so engravers were not
allowed to exhibit at the Royal Academy and
were given no honors at all. Edwin’s father
thought this was not right, and gave several
lectures in defense of the art. Engraving, he
said, was a kind of “sculpture performed by
incision.” His talks seemed to be of no avail
at the time, but in the year following his death,
engravers at last received the recognition due
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>His eldest son, Thomas, also became famous
as an engraver, and it is to him we are indebted
for so many good prints of Sir Edwin Landseer’s
paintings. This son is the one who made the
engraving of the “Horse Fair” for Rosa Bonheur.
Few people can afford to own great paintings,
but the prints come within the means of almost
all of us.</p>

<p class='c012'>Edwin’s father taught him to draw, and
he learned so quickly that even when he was
only five years old he could draw remarkably
well. Edwin had three sisters and two brothers.
The family lived in the country, and often
the father went with his boys for a walk through
the fields. There were two very large fields
separated from each other by a fence with an
old-fashioned stile. This stile had about four
steps and was built high, so that the sheep
and cows pastured in the fields could not jump
over. One day Edwin stopped here to admire
these animals and asked his father to show
him how to draw them. His father took a
piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket,
and showed Edwin how to draw a cow. This
was the boy’s first drawing lesson. After this
Edwin came here nearly every day, and his
father called these two fields “Edwin’s studio.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When he was only thirteen years old two
of his pictures were exhibited at the Royal
Academy. One was a painting of a mule, the
other of a dog and puppy. Edwin painted
from real life always, not caring to make copies
from the work of others. All the sketches he
made when he was a little boy were carefully
kept by his father, and now, if you go to
England, you may see them in the South
Kensington Museum, in London.</p>

<p class='c012'>Landseer was only sixteen years old when
he exhibited his wonderful picture called
“Fighting Dogs Getting Wind.” A very
rich man, whose praise meant a great deal at
that time, bought the picture, and Edwin’s
success was assured. So many people brought
their pets for him to paint that he had to keep
a list and each was obliged to wait his turn.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was about this time, too, that he painted
an old white horse in the stable of another
wealthy man. After the picture was finished
and ready to deliver, it suddenly disappeared.
It was sought everywhere, but it was not
found until twenty-four years afterwards. A
servant had stolen it and hidden it away in a
hayloft. He was afraid to sell it, or even to
keep it in his home, for every one would recognize
the great artist’s work.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a number of years Landseer lived and
painted in his father’s house in a poor little
room without even a carpet. All the furniture,
we are told, consisted of three cheap chairs
and an easel. Later he had a fine studio not
far from Regent’s Park. There were a small
house and garden, and the barn was made over
into a studio.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Edwin was not a very good business
man, so he left all his financial affairs to his
father, who sold his pictures for him and kept
his accounts.</p>

<p class='c012'>At twenty-four Landseer became a member
of the Royal Academy, which was an unusual
honor for so young a man.</p>

<p class='c012'>This story is told of him. At a social
gathering in the home of a well-known leader
of society in London, where Landseer was
present, the company had been talking about
skill with the hands, when some one remarked
that no one had ever been found who could draw
two things at once. Landseer replied, “Oh, I
can do that; lend me two pencils and I will
show you.” Then with one hand he quickly
drew the head of a horse, at the same time
drawing with the other hand a deer’s head and
antlers. Both sketches were so good that they
might well have been drawn with the same
hand and with much more care.</p>

<p class='c012'>Landseer made a special study of lions, too.
A lion died at the park menagerie, and Landseer
dissected its body and studied and drew every
part. He painted many pictures of lions. He
modeled the lions at the base of the Nelson
Monument in Trafalgar Square, London, unveiled
in 1867.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Sir Edwin Landseer went to visit Scotland
one of his fellow travelers was Sir Walter
Scott, the great novelist. The two became warm
friends. Sir Walter Scott tells us: “Landseer’s
dogs were the most magnificent things I ever
saw, leaping and bounding and grinning all over
the canvas.” Landseer painted Sir Walter
Scott’s handsome dog, “Maida Vale,” many
times, and named his studio for the dog.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although Landseer painted so many wild
animals, birds, and hunting scenes, he did not
care to shoot animals or to hunt. His sketchbook
was his only weapon. Sometimes he
would hire guides to take him into the wildest
parts of the country in search of game. But
they felt quite disgusted with him when, a
great deer bounding toward them, he would
merely make a sketch of it in his book. He
knew how to use a gun, though, and sometimes
did so with great success.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was the study of live animals that
interested him most. Sir Edwin Landseer felt
that animals understand, feel, and reason just
like people, so he painted them as happy, sad,
gay, dignified, frivolous, rich, poor, and in all
ways, just like human beings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Landseer did and said all he could against
the custom of cutting, or “cropping,” the ears
of dogs. He held that nature intended to protect
the ears of dogs that “dig in the dirt,” and
man should not interfere. People paid attention
to what he said, and the custom lost favor.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1850 the honor of knighthood was conferred
upon the artist.</p>

<p class='c012'>Landseer was popular alike with lovers of
art and simple lovers of nature who had no
knowledge of painting. No English painter
has ever been more appreciated in his own
country.</p>

<p class='c012'>He died in London in 1873, at the age of
seventy-one.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other noted pictures by Landseer are:
“The Highland Shepherd’s Chief Mourner,”
“Suspense,” “The Connoisseurs,” “A Distinguished
Member of the Royal Humane
Society,” “Saved,” “My Dog,” “Dignity and
Impudence,” “Sleeping Bloodhound,” “Shoeing
the Bay Mare,” “Monarch of the Glen,”
and “A Deer Family.”</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> The paintings of
Peter Paul Rubens were in such demand that
he employed a great number of skilled assistants
to help him paint them. He himself worked
some on each picture, making the first sketch
and adding the finishing touches, but in many
of them his carefully trained assistants put in
the details of costume, background, and even
the hands and faces. Rubens worked out a
system of his own by which all were kept busy,
and a remarkably large number of pictures
finished in a short time. Some critics have
spoken of his studio as a “manufactory for the
production of religious and decorative pictures.”
Knowing this, it can be readily understood how
much more this picture, called “Rubens’s
Sons,” is valued because the artist painted
every stroke himself. He would not allow any
one else to touch it, and later, owing to its
great popularity, it is believed he made a copy
of the painting, as there are two in existence.</p>

<p class='c012'>The brothers, Albert and Nicholas, are so
lifelike that they almost seem to breathe and
move. The elder son, Albert, was twelve years
old when this picture was painted, and his
brother Nicholas, eight. Albert, always a studious
boy, looks thoughtfully at us as he half
leans against the pillar. In his gloved right
hand he holds a book, while in his bare left
hand, resting on his brother’s shoulder, he holds
the other fur-edged glove.</p>

<p class='c012'>The younger boy, Nicholas, is absorbed in
his plaything, a goldfinch fastened by a string
to a wooden perch. He shrewdly calculates
the distance he must let out the string, and his
alert, eager attention tells us much of the stirring,
restless life of this healthy, active boy.
It is difficult to keep him standing still very long.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rubens delighted in painting rich velvets,
brocades, silks, and satins, and especially in
representing his wife and their children in
beautiful clothes. In this picture he has certainly
satisfied that desire, for the boys are
dressed in most elaborate costumes even for that
day, and especially so if we compare them
with the simple dark suits of boys of the same
age to-day. Nicholas’s suit is of gray and blue,
with puffs of yellow satin, rosettes below his
knees and on his shoes, lace collar and cuffs, and
innumerable little buttons. Albert wears black
satin slashed with white, white ruched collars
and cuffs, and a soft black felt hat. At a glance
we would judge them to be the sons of a gentleman,
well brought up, healthy, happy, and
manly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The great studio in which Rubens worked
was like a school, for many young artists came
there to learn how to draw and paint. Rubens
worked away at his own easel while the students
and helpers were seated about the room, each
carefully working out some part on the canvas
before him. Occasionally he would stop his
painting long enough to look at the others’ work,
correct their mistakes, and help them. Often,
as he worked, Rubens would have some one
read aloud to him in Latin, for he was a fine
scholar and liked to keep up his knowledge.
The boy Albert loved to sit on a stool near his
father, watching and listening, and as soon as
he was able to write at all he could read and
write in Latin. Always fond of reading and
studying, he gained such a reputation for scholarship
that when he was only sixteen years old
the king of Spain, Philip IV, appointed him to
a very important position—secretary to the
Privy Council.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whenever Rubens went on a long journey
he brought back many curios, such as cameos,
jewels, old coins, and relics of all kinds. Soon
he had so many collected he put them all in
one room, which he called the “museum room.”
Albert loved to study the curious things in
this room, and spent hours alone here while
Nicholas was romping out in the great yard.
When Albert grew up he wrote several books
about antiquities and curios.</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> The great Flemish
painter, Peter Paul Rubens, was born at Siegen,
Germany, during the forced exile of his parents
from their home in Antwerp, Belgium. But
Rubens always claimed citizenship at Antwerp,
and spent most of his life there after
the death of his father.</p>

<p class='c012'>His mother sent him to a Jesuit college,
where, besides his religious training, he gained
a mastery of languages. According to the
customs of those times he was next sent as a
page to the home of a great lady; but this was
not to his liking and he soon returned home.
His mother wished him to be a lawyer, as his
father had been, but Rubens persuaded her to
help him in his ambition to be a painter.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next ten years he spent at home, studying
under the direction of local artists, until
at the age of twenty-three he was so filled with
the desire to visit Italy that he set out for
Venice. He spent much time copying the
paintings of the Venetian masters, and it was
while he was working on one of these copies
that a gentleman belonging to the court of the
Duke of Mantua found him, and praised his
work so highly to the duke that Rubens was
sent for. Then for eight years Rubens held
the position of court painter for the Duke of
Mantua.</p>

<p class='c012'>In appearance he was tall, well built, and
good looking, carrying himself with grace and
an air of distinction. Cultured, with pleasant
manners and such unusual talent, it is not
strange that he made friends wherever he went.</p>

<p class='c012'>The story is told that one day as he was
painting a picture the subject of which he had
chosen from Virgil, “The Struggle of Turnus
with Æneas,” he recited the Latin aloud to
himself. The duke, happening to pass that
way, heard him, and coming into the studio
spoke to him in Latin, not for an instant believing
he would understand, but Rubens answered
in perfect Latin. The duke was amazed, for
his idea of painters did not include their having
a knowledge of the classics. He then inquired
about the artist’s birth and education, and so
Rubens, with his great talent, was held in even
greater favor at court.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rubens made a journey to Spain for the Duke
of Mantua, taking with him as presents copies
of some of the celebrated Italian paintings and
a number of horses to be presented to King
Philip III and to the Duke of Lerma. The
Duke of Mantua was famous throughout Europe
for his fine horses, and it is said that those
appearing so often in Rubens’s paintings were
chosen from among the duke’s favorites. On
this journey Rubens took the wrong road,
crossing the Alps with great difficulty. The
baggage, drawn by oxen over the steep mountain
roads, delayed him, and the paintings
were almost ruined by heavy rains, which made
it necessary for him to spend many days retouching
them before they could be presented.
He was so successful in this task, and the
journey had given them such an appearance of
age, that the king thought they must be the
“genuine originals of the old masters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The horses, however, arrived in fine condition,
for, as the story goes, they had been
bathed in wine several times during the
journey, which greatly improved the glossiness
of their coats.</p>

<p class='c012'>After his return Rubens continued his travels
through Italy, whenever he could secure a leave
of absence from the duke, but was finally called
back to Antwerp by the death of his mother.
When he would have returned to the duke’s
court he was persuaded by the Archduke Albert
and his wife to remain in Antwerp, where he
was offered the position of court painter at a
most generous salary.</p>

<p class='c012'>He then built a magnificent home and
married Isabella Brant, whose portrait he has
painted so often. This house was so arranged
that he could use part of it for his school, to
which students came from all parts of Europe.
Each student was taught to do a certain part
of a picture well, and most of them had their
part in the great paintings, which were first
planned and then retouched by Rubens. For
this work Rubens always gave them credit,
and in his list of pictures he has permitted no
deception. Thus we find among his notes:</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Prometheus bound—with an eagle who
gnaws his liver. Original by my hand, eagle
by Snyder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Leopards, painted from life, with Satyrs
and Nymphs. Original by my hand, except a
very beautiful landscape done by a very distinguished
artist in that style.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Twelve Apostles and Christ, painted
by my pupils after originals by my hand—they
could all be retouched by my hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such a great number of pictures are attributed
to Rubens and his helpers that some are to
be found in every gallery in Europe.</p>

<p class='c012'>His paintings were in demand not only in
the Netherlands but in other countries. In
France, Maria de Medici commissioned him
to paint pictures illustrating the chief events
in her life, to be placed in the gallery of the
Luxembourg Palace. There were twenty-one
of these pictures in all besides three portraits.</p>

<p class='c012'>A beautiful friendship existed between the
two artists, Rubens and Velasquez, although
Rubens was twenty-two years older than his
young friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other paintings by Rubens are: “Adoration
of the Magi,” “The Garland of Fruit,”
“The Descent from the Cross,” “The Last
Communion of St. Francis,” “Judgment of
Paris,” and “Peace and War.”</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> It is said that the
artist, Jules Breton, was walking in the fields of
France early one morning when suddenly there
burst forth the joyous song of a lark singing
high in the air. As he looked about him,
trying to discover the bird, he soon found it by
following the rapt gaze of a peasant girl who had
stopped to look and listen. As you know, an
English lark sings while flying high in the air
instead of in the treetops as other birds do. Its
song, too, is longer and far more beautiful than
that of our lark, and has been the subject of
many poems. Perhaps the best known are
“Hark, Hark, the Lark,” by Shakespeare, and
“To a Skylark,” by Shelley.</p>

<p class='c012'>The last line of this verse by Shelley is
often quoted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Higher still and higher</div>
      <div class='line in5'>From the earth thou springest</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Like a cloud of fire;</div>
      <div class='line in5'>The blue deep thou wingest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Jules Breton has tried to show us what he
saw that morning, and to help us find the lark
through the joyous expression on the girl’s
face. Her lips are parted as she listens breathlessly
to the exquisite song of praise the lark
is pouring forth. The sun, a huge, fiery ball,
is rising just behind the trees of the distant
village, and all the earth is flooded with its
golden light.</p>

<p class='c012'>This sturdy, healthy peasant girl, sickle in
hand, is going forth to her work in the fields.
She walks along briskly in the narrow path,
her head thrown back, breathing in the fresh
morning air, when suddenly her little friend,
the lark, gives her the morning greeting. As
we look at her we do not feel that this is the
first time she has heard his sweet song, but
rather that it is something she has learned to
look and listen for each morning as she starts
out to her day’s work.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another Frenchman, Millet, painted the
French peasant so that our feelings of pity are
aroused, but Breton shows us such strong,
happy, peasant girls that we are apt rather to
envy them their life of outdoor freedom and
healthful labor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Millet says of these peasants, “Breton paints
girls who are too beautiful to remain in the
country.” Other critics declare that Breton’s
wonderful sunrises and sunsets would make
any figure stand out transfigured, and as he
chooses as models only the most favored in
strength and beauty, of course the results are
unusual.</p>

<p class='c012'>This picture is so full of joy and song that
it fills us with wonder and appreciation of all
that is beautiful in nature. First, there is the
bird with its wonderful power to soar so high
and to so fill the air with its beautiful song.
Then the sun, and all that it makes possible
for us in life and growth. It seems indeed a
privilege for this happy-hearted peasant girl
to be permitted to go out in the fields on this
bright, fresh morning to do her little share in
the work of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her apron is caught up about her waist to
hold the heads of wheat, for, as her sickle
indicates, she is going into the wheat field. A
large handkerchief is fastened about her hair to
protect it from the dust and dirt of the field.
She is dressed for a warm day in summer. Her
large, coarse hands and feet, hardened by exposure
and toil, suggest health and strength
and give us a feeling of admiration rather
than of pity.</p>

<p class='c012'>The details of the field and even of her dress
are made secondary and unimportant compared
with her face, upon which is centered our chief
interest and to which our eyes are continually
drawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the little village faintly seen in the
distance we catch a glimpse of the homes of
the peasants,—simple, rude homes, yet, if we
may judge by this girl’s expression, cheerful
and happy homes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Breton has avoided all possibility of monotony
in his picture by the unequal division of
space. Had the figure of the girl been placed
exactly in the center of the landscape, or the
earth and sky spaces been made equal, the
picture would have lost much in interest, as
you will soon discover if you cover up parts
of the composition with a piece of paper.
Although there is no rule stating that the
center of interest should not be in the middle of
a picture, most artists seem to prefer centering
their interest on some person or object a little
to one side of the middle.</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions to help the pupil understand the

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Jules Adolphe Breton
was the son of cultured, well-to-do parents.
When he was only four years old his mother
died and he was brought up, with other children,
by his father and an uncle who came to live
with them at this time. In the great yard or
park about his father’s house there were four
statues representing the four seasons of the
year—spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Jules loved to look at these statues, and when
one day a painter came and repainted them a
bright green, he watched every movement of
the brush with great delight. He was only six
years old, but that night he announced to his
father that he was going to be an artist.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he was ten years old his father sent
him to a religious school. At this school there
was a large black dog named Coco, a general
favorite, whose picture Jules often drew. One
day he drew Coco in a black gown like the
priest’s, and standing on his hind feet, holding
a book in his paws. He named his picture
“The Abbé Coco Reads His Breviary.” The
priest, his teacher, happening to see this picture,
was much displeased, and demanded, “Did
you do this through impiety or to laugh at your
masters?” Jules was frightened, and not knowing
exactly what “impiety” meant, but feeling
sure that to “laugh at your masters” would
be a serious offense, he answered tremblingly,
“Through impiety.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For this he was severely whipped, much to
the indignation of his father, who promptly took
him out of the school. Jules was then sent
to another school, where he was taught drawing,
and from that time on he painted pictures
which won for him great popularity.</p>

<p class='c012'>He has received medals and other honors in
England, France, and America. Some of his
best pictures are in the United States, among
them “The Song of the Lark,” which is usually
considered his masterpiece.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other noted pictures are: “The Vintagers,”
“Return of the Gleaners,” “Blessing the Grain,”
“Women Weeding,” “The Turkey Keeper,”
and “The Shepherd’s Star.”</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the picture.</b> Long ago, in the
age of chivalry, there lived a beautiful Florentine
lady named Beatrice Portinari. A great poet,
Dante, has described her to us from her childhood
to her death.</p>

<p class='c012'>In those days when all true knights served
their ladies, and even small boys were required
to choose objects of devotion, it was not strange
that a boy of nine years should choose a little
neighbor girl for this honor. She was only a
year younger than he when her father, Folco
Portinari, a rich nobleman of Florence, gave
a festival in her honor, inviting all his neighbors
and friends. Dante went with his father.
Here for the first time he met Beatrice, whom
he afterwards described as “the youngest of
the angels.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘People called her Beatrice then,’ he explains,
‘without knowing how truly the name
belonged to her, for it means ‘one who blesses.’”
The artist, Rossetti, must have been thinking of
this when he named his picture “Beata Beatrix,”
which means “happy or pleasing; one who
blesses.” Beata sometimes has another meaning—“the
elect of Paradise”—and Dante suggests
this meaning as he tells us how the people
remarked, as she passed, that “she seemed not
to be the daughter of a mortal man, but of God.”
Indeed, he tells us that whoever looked at her
was made better, for all ill thoughts must vanish
before her,—“the destroyer of all evil, and the
queen of all good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She must have been a fairylike little creature
as she moved among her father’s guests, dressed
in deep crimson, with a few beautiful ornaments
which brought out her delicate coloring. At
any rate she became the ideal of the small boy,
Dante. He became a poet through this meeting
and from that time on wrote verses to
her. We probably never would have known
there was such a person as Beatrice, if he had not
told us about her in his poems. Now she will
never be forgotten, for not only the poet Dante,
but the artist Rossetti, made her name immortal.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not until nine years after this first
meeting that Dante met Beatrice face to face
again. She was walking on the street between
two older women, and turned to greet him
pleasantly. Dressed in white this time, she
seemed to him the fairest and most beautiful
lady in all Florence.</p>

<p class='c012'>This meeting had such an effect upon Dante
that he declared he felt as if he had reached the
“furthest limit of blessedness.” Hurrying to his
room, he spent hours in thinking of Beatrice;—finally
he fell asleep and dreamed of her. As
soon as he awoke, he commenced a sonnet,
which he addressed, not to her, but to his fellow-poets.
It was not until later that he ventured
to address his verses to Beatrice, usually speaking
of her as “my lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After each meeting or new thought of Beatrice,
Dante wrote his poems, until at last he put
them all into a book which he called “Vita
Nuova,” meaning “new life.” He declared that
from the time of his first meeting with Beatrice
he had begun a new life, and this book would
contain the record of it. Here he tells all his
inmost thoughts and feelings, for in those days it
was the fashion for poets to tell of their loves.</p>

<p class='c012'>So we hear how Dante spent his days and
nights thinking of the lovely Beatrice, until his
health began to fail and his friends questioned,
even taunted him, as to the cause. He did not
wish them to know who it was that so affected
him, and was wondering how to keep his secret
when an accident showed him the way. As
he sat in church looking across to where his
beloved Beatrice sat unconscious of his presence,
his glance was returned by a lady sitting
half way between. She thought his glances
were for her. She looked around several times,
and other people, noticing her, soon decided she
must be the lady Dante loved. Dante then
decided to use her as a screen, and though he
continued to write his verses to Beatrice, he did
so in such a way that all believed they were
directed to the screen lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>This did very well for several years, until
the screen lady moved to another city. Then
Dante chose another screen lady, but she got
him into trouble. False rumors spread rapidly
and soon the gentle Beatrice heard them. So
one day, when she passed Dante on the street,
she did not give him the customary greeting.
He was nearly heartbroken, for this greeting was
all the recompense he had ever had or hoped to
have for his love. He tells how much it meant
to him, how kindly it made him feel toward
even his enemies, and that it was the inspiration
and hope of his life.</p>

<p class='c012'>A friend took him to a wedding feast at which
Beatrice was one of the guests. At the sight
of her he grew faint and was obliged to return
home. As he passed a group of women, they
stopped him and inquired what kind of a love
his was that made him numb and speechless in
the mere presence of the loved one. He told
them that until the day when Beatrice refused
it, the end and aim of his love had been “her
salutation”; but now his desire had changed to
something that could not fail him: His happiness
now lay “in the words which praise my
lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Is it any wonder then that one so gentle and
beautiful as Beatrice, and to whom the attention
of all Florence was directed by the adoration of
so beloved a poet as Dante, should become a
kind of goddess or queen in that city? Dante
tells us that people came to the corners of the
streets to see her pass. Her companions, too,
were honored for her sake, and it seemed as if
Beatrice herself was “the only creature in Florence
unaware of her own perfections.” It gave
him the most exquisite pleasure to think that he
had helped bring this about.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the death of Beatrice’s father, Dante’s
grief was almost as deep as for his own father,
and he remained near the house in the vain hope
that he might comfort his lady in some way.
Shortly after this, Dante became very ill, and
as he thought of death, he realized that some day
his beloved Beatrice must die. The thought
drove him into a frenzy of despair; and when at
last he fell asleep, it was only to dream of her
approaching death. This dream proved to be
a true omen, for only once more was Dante
permitted to see his Beatrice; then one day as
he was composing a sonnet to her, the news of
her death was brought to him. He was prostrated
with grief, and it was some time before
he could write again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dante was then twenty-seven years old, and
left, as he said, “to ruminate on death, and envy
whomsoever dies.” To console himself he read
religious philosophy, and from thinking of
Beatrice as a saint upon earth, he began to think
of her in heaven in company with saints and
angels. And so almost before he knew it he had
started to write his masterpiece, “The Divine
Comedy.” In this, Beatrice, still the object of
his adoration, leads him from circle to circle in
Paradise, and for the first time we hear her
speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is strange how very little is known of
Beatrice from other sources. Beyond the fact
of her birth and parentage little is given. Many
authorities state she was the wife of Simone de’
Bardi, but as many vigorously deny this.
Dante does not mention her marriage, and
indeed gives us quite the opposite impression.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dante has represented his Beatrice as so
perfect, so absolutely without fault in every
way, that many have questioned whether she
was a real woman or an ideal. Perhaps the
doubt as to her reality started when people
began to ask more about her and her interest
in Dante. Living in Florence, she must have
known of his devotion, yet we have no way of
knowing whether she knew or not. And then
we are permitted to see Beatrice only at a distance,
and usually surrounded by her bodyguard
of gentle ladies. We know how she
affected other people, the beauty and sweetness
of her presence, yet we are never brought close
enough to see even the hint of an imperfection
of any kind. And the poet himself does not
address his poems directly to her, but “to other
poetic souls who will understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet who can read his “Vita Nuova” and
fail to be convinced that Beatrice was an actual
woman? Here we find her beautiful, gentle,
modest, and smiling, walking with others,
prayerful in church, weeping at funerals, and
merry at festivals. All the little events of her
life, and even the peace of her death, are sympathetically
told by one who knew her to be
real, yet has made her truly ideal.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Vita Nuova” was written in Italian,
and one of the best English translations was
made by Rossetti, who painted this picture as
one of the many illustrations for the book. No
one could have been more in sympathy with
this subject than Rossetti; both because of his
great admiration for Dante, and because he had
suffered a similar affliction in the loss of his
beloved wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dante sought to prove in verse that death
is but passing from one world into another, and
Rossetti wished to show Beatrice in that transition
stage, or swoon, in which she is about to
pass into another life. In his own words Rossetti
tells us, “The picture illustrates the ‘Vita
Nuova,’ embodying symbolically the death of
Beatrice as treated in that work. The picture
is not intended at all to represent death, but to
render it under the semblance of a trance in
which Beatrice, seated at a balcony overlooking
the city, is suddenly rapt from earth to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We are supposed to be in an adjoining room
in the home of Beatrice, and to be looking out
upon the balcony where she is sitting. Her
closed eyes, half-closed lips, and listless hands
make her appear to be half sleeping, half waking,
yet conscious of some heavenly vision we
cannot see. The dove, crowned with a halo to
show that it is a heavenly messenger, brings the
poppy to Beatrice. This flower is the symbol
of death; the dark heart of the flower stands
for mystery and the white petals for purity.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sundial represents the hour as close at
hand. Dante was quite superstitious about the
number nine, and in his book refers to that
number so often that this picture would not be
complete without some indication of it. He
was nine years old when he met Beatrice; nine
years later he received her salutation; it was
usually on the ninth hour that he saw or dreamed
of her; and it was at the ninth hour that she
passed away.</p>

<p class='c012'>As we glance away from Beatrice, beyond
the balcony we catch a glimpse of the Florence
in which she lived, with its river Arno, its bridge,
and some of the towers and palaces in the dim
distance. The two figures gazing sadly at one
another represent Dante and Love. In his
“Vita Nuova,” Dante always speaks of Love
as an actual person appearing to him in different
forms. First he appeared as a traveler dressed
in coarse clothes; then as a youth in white who
came and sat on the edge of his bed and comforted
him; and on those rare occasions when
Dante saw Beatrice he was always present.
Dressed in vermilion in this picture, he stands
holding a flaming heart and pointing upward,
as if he would beckon Dante to follow. Critics
generally agree that the figure of Love in this
picture represents the spiritual Beatrice, who
beckons Dante to follow as she passes upward.
Dante, dressed in scholarly gown, gazes fixedly
at the figure as if he would not fail to get the
message.</p>

<p class='c012'>The colors in which this picture is painted
add much to its air of mystery. The purplish
tints of late sunset linger in the distant view of
the city and bring out the golden auburn hair
of Beatrice, suggesting a halo made radiant
against the twilight distance. Yet Rossetti
has been very careful to make Beatrice appear
as a real person and not as a vision. To accomplish
this, he has made the figure stand out
clearly against the brilliant light, yet lost in the
half shadows of the balcony, so she appears to
be both of this world and of the next. He has
represented life and death again in the colors
of her dress,—green and purple. She wears
a loose-fitting green garment over a purple dress.
The bird is a deep rose color. It carries the
purplish white poppy to her lap.</p>

<p class='c012'>This picture of Beata Beatrix is dated 1863,
but was not finished until two years later.
Nine years afterwards, Rossetti painted a copy
of it, adding the meeting of Beatrice and Dante
in Paradise. He painted several other copies,
but none of them have been considered equal to
this first picture. The original was painted in
oils and sold to Lord Mount Temple, whose
widow gave it as a memorial to the National
Gallery, London, where it now hangs.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rossetti designed nearly all the frames for
his pictures, because he liked to show on them
some of the things that suggested the picture.
He took unusual pains in designing the frame
for this painting. On the sides are circles
showing clouds, stars, and skies, representing
the two worlds. Below the painting he has
printed the date of the death of Beatrice,
June 9, 1290, and a quotation in Latin from the
Bible illustrating the effect of her death upon
Florence:</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The story of the artist.</b> Daniel Gabriel
Rossetti was the eldest son of Gabriele Rossetti,
a poet and Italian exile. Gabriel, for that was
the name he was usually called, was born at
Portland Place, London, and had two sisters
and one brother. He was first sent to a private
school, then to King’s College School. When
he was but fourteen, because of his marked
ability to draw he was sent to Cary’s Art
Academy. Here he did so well that three years
later he gained admission to the Royal Academy
Antique School.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was only twenty years old when with
some other young artists he started a new art
movement which they agreed, half in jest, to
call Pre-Raphaelitism. They themselves were
called Pre-Raphaelites. When they began to
exhibit their paintings, they were very severely
criticized and ridiculed; but a popular young
art critic of that day, John Ruskin, came to their
aid by writing a long letter in which he praised
them heartily. This letter was published and
turned the tide of popular opinion. Meanwhile,
Rossetti was developing his literary talents, his
writings being published in the leading magazines
of that time.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day a young artist friend of Rossetti’s
went with his mother into a millinery shop,
where, glancing through an open door, he saw
a number of young girls at work. Among them
was one who had the beautiful reddish auburn
hair which was the favorite color among the
Pre-Raphaelites. The young man persuaded
his mother to ask the girl if she would pose for
him. The girl’s name was Elizabeth Siddall,
and from posing for this friend she soon became
acquainted with other artists, among them,
Rossetti. She showed considerable artistic ability
herself, and it is said that John Ruskin,
wishing her to give up her trade and devote
herself to art, promised to buy all the pictures
she could paint, if she would study with Rossetti.
This delighted Rossetti, who felt more
than interested in this new pupil.</p>

<p class='c012'>Judging from the paintings Rossetti made of
her at this time she must have been a beautiful
young girl. Besides her good looks she must
have had a brilliant mind, for she learned
rapidly, and soon became not only a good artist
but a writer and judge of good literature. Then
she discovered that her education had been
much neglected, so with Rossetti’s and Ruskin’s
help she went away to school to perfect
herself. She did this because she believed she
would then be able to help Rossetti more in his
work. When she returned to London, they were
married.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their marriage was a very happy one, but
hardly two years had passed when the young
wife died.</p>

<p class='c012'>During these two years Rossetti was inspired
in his work in art and literature by his
beautiful wife, and it was at her request that
he copied the poems he had addressed to her into
a little book which she had given to him for
that purpose. Overcome by grief at her death,
Rossetti wrapped this volume in his wife’s
beautiful hair as she lay in her coffin, and so it
was buried with her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Seven years later he was persuaded to secure
this book again, and its publication brought him
much honor. But he felt much remorse because
he had permitted the grave to be opened, and,
some very severe and unkind criticisms coming
to him at this time, his health began to fail. He
found he could not sleep, and although he knew
their terrible effects, he commenced taking
narcotics. All the rest of Rossetti’s life was
spent in a constant struggle against them until
at last they conquered in his death.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not strange that Rossetti should have
been interested in Dante and his writings.
Rossetti’s father was so great an admirer of
Dante that he named his son for him, and wrote
many articles about him. Rossetti’s sister, too,
wrote a book about Dante, his life and works,
which she called “The Shadow of Dante.”</p>

<p class='c012'>You can easily see how, after the death of
his wife, the story of the death of Beatrice would
affect Rossetti; and it is little wonder that the
Beatrice of the “Beata Beatrix” should resemble
his own wife. However, he did not intend this
as a portrait of his wife, but only meant to show
that love continues after death, and that what
men call death is but a swooning into another
life. Nearly all of Rossetti’s paintings are connected
more or less with the tragedy of his own
life, and through them we come to understand
what that life must have been.</p>

<p class='c012'>He painted many literary subjects, and
among those illustrating the life of Dante and
Beatrice are:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Il Saluto di Beatrice,” which represents the
meeting of Beatrice and Dante first in a street
of Florence, and then in Paradise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dante Drawing the Angel”—a year after
Beatrice’s death Dante observed the anniversary
by drawing the angel which represented
Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Beatrice at the Wedding Feast, Denying
her Salutation to Dante.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dante’s Dream.” This is the largest picture
Rossetti ever painted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Other paintings are: “The Blessed Damozel,”
“The Spirit of the Rainbow,” “Forced Music,”
“The Bower Meadow,” “The Beloved.”</p>
<p class='c011'><b>Questions about the artist.</b> Where was Rossetti

  <h2 id='suggs' class='c007'>THE SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><b>Studying the picture.</b> Several days before the lesson is to
be taken up, the picture to be studied should be placed where
every pupil can see it.</p>

<p class='c012'>First of all, the children should find out for themselves
what is in the picture. The questions accompanying the
story of each picture are intended to help them to do this.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Language work.</b> The pupils should be encouraged in class
to talk freely and naturally. In this way the lesson becomes
a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom
of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images.</p>

<p class='c012'>If a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period, the
children should be asked to retell the story of the picture.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Dramatization and drawing.</b> Most of the stories told by the
pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and, whenever
practicable, such stories should be acted out. The stories
also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used
as subjects for drawing lessons.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>The review lesson.</b> The review lesson should cover all pictures
and artists studied throughout the year. At this time
other pictures available by the same artists should be on
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c012'>The review work may be conducted as a contest in which
the pictures are held up, one at a time, while the class writes
the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which
have been prepared and numbered for that purpose. One
teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting
those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the
large-sized Perry pictures studied.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many teachers, however, will prefer to use this time for
composition work, although the description of pictures is often
given as an English lesson. Pupils may write a description of
their favorite picture. In fact, the lessons can be made to
correlate with history, geography, English, spelling, reading, or
nature study.</p>

<p class='c012'>In any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils
shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize
them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the
interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation
and understanding of the artist’s work. Thus the children
will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good,
the true, and the beautiful in everything about them.</p>
